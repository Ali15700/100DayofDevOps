# Getting started with Golang
Today was my first day to learn Go Language.I shared all the details what I learned today. 

Golang is the most common tool among DevOps professionals.The popular DevOps tools are written in Go, such as Docker, and even the open-source container orchestration system Kubernetes is built on go.

**Golang** has comparitively fast compile time and simple while **C/C++**(My Previous Programming Language) has complex system type and slow compile time.












## Installation

👉 Download Go [Click here](https://go.dev/doc/install)

👉 Open MSI file you downloaded from the above link ☝️

👉 By default, The installer will install go to Program files or Program file(x86)
 
👉 Open VS Code then go to Extensions and install *Go extension* 

👉 create file with **.go** extension and you will see popups to install go dependencies in folder.Click on all install

## Key Features in Golang

👉 Simple and minimalist

👉 Fast Compile time

👉 Garbage Collected

👉 Built-in concurrency

## Data Types in Go

Go is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.

This is how you can use data types
#### Different datatypes example

  var a bool = true     // Boolean

  var b int = 5         // Integer

  var c float32 = 3.14  // Floating point number

  var d string = "Hi!"  // String


## Deployment

To run this project

```bash
  go run findAge.go
```
### Output

```bash
PS C:\Users\Beast\Desktop\MyProjects\go> go run findAge.go
Enter the year of birth:2000
Your age is: 22
```
