# Getting started with Golang
Today was my first day to learn Go Language.I shared all the details what I learned today. 

Golang is the most common tool among DevOps professionals.The popular DevOps tools are written in Go, such as Docker, and even the open-source container orchestration system Kubernetes is built on go.

**Golang** has comparitively fast compile time and simple while **C/C++**(My Previous Programming Language) has complex system type and slow compile time.












## Installation

👉 Download Go [Click here](https://go.dev/doc/install)

👉 Open MSI file you downloaded from the above link ☝️

👉 By default, The installer will install go to Program files or Program file(x86)
 
👉 Open VS Code then go to Extensions and install *Go extension* 

👉 create file with **.go** extension and you will see popups to install go dependencies in folder.Click on all install

## Key Features in Golang

👉 Simple and minimalist

👉 Fast Compile time

👉 Garbage Collected

👉 Built-in concurrency

## Data Types in Go

Go is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.

This is how you can use data types
#### Different datatypes example

  var a bool = true     // Boolean

  var b int = 5         // Integer

  var c float32 = 3.14  // Floating point number

  var d string = "Hi!"  // String


## Switch in Go

The difference in **switch statement in GO** and other PL's is that it only runs the matched case so it does not need a break statement.

#### Working 

👉 *Switch Expression*'s value  is compared with the values of each case

👉 If it matches with corresponding value then associated code block will be executed otherwise it will run **default** code block.

👉 **All the case values should have the same type as the switch expression** otherwise it will through an **error**
## IF ELSE Condition

A condition can be either **true** or **false**

👉 **If** code block will be always executed if condition is **true** otherwise **else**  code block will be executed.

👉 **else if** will be used when you have to check multiple conditions and executed **true** condition.

## Loops

👉 When you have to run same piece code over and over then you use loops.

👉 Each execution of a loop is called an iteration.

👉 **For** loop is the only loop in *GO*
## Deployment

To run these projects

```bash
  go run findAge.go
```

```bash
  go run switchDays.go
```

```bash
  go run largestNumber.go
```

### Output

```bash
PS C:\Users\Beast\Desktop\MyProjects\go> go run findAge.go
Enter the year of birth:2000
Your age is: 22
```
```bash
PS C:\Users\Beast\Desktop\MyProjects\go> go run switchDays.go
Enter the Name of Week Day:Thursday
Test the code
```
```bash
PS C:\Users\Beast\Desktop\MyProjects\go> go run largestNumber.go
Largest Value:4325
```
